        Analog Communications      : Matlab Code FIles - For Software Simulation based
        MPMC(Micro Processor and Micro Controllers)  : Assembly Language Based 


**Note** 

1. We could not able to use Open Source Tools during our course work due to Academic restrictions However, it is encouragable to use OPen Source tools such as **Octave**, **Scilab** and **Code Blocks** .
2. Matlab in 2014 is different after 2018. Matlab today, is more advanced and has more predefined functions when compared to 2014 versions..
